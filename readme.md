# Be a part of the magic.
We've been busy planning our 2019 season since the curtain closed on our 59th consecutive season last July.
But we can't get it alone. We need you to be a part of it.
### Jobs
It takes a village. We need your talent to make this season a success.
We're hiring actors, lighting designers, sound engineers, directors, stage managers, set designers, summer camp directors and more this year.
[Learn more](http://jacobdecastro.github.iuo/shawnee/jobs.md) about working here and how to apply.
### Sponsors
Reach thousands of Shawnee visitors this summer and support a Greene County nonprofit. Without the support of local businesses like yours, our season would not be possible.
We're looking for season presenting sponsors, show sponsors and more for this season.

### Questions?
Don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to answer any questions you may have.
